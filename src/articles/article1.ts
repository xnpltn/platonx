Several years ago, precisely five, my journey into programming 
commenced fueled by a fascination with video games. Temple Run,
 a mobile game I used to enjoy, sparked my curiosity about its development process. 
Discovering that creating something akin to it required coding skills, I delved into the world of programming


When seeking guidance from friends pursuing computer science at my school, 
their unanimous response was, "It will be challenging for you." 
Despite the caution, they recommended starting with HTML and CSS. 
I embarked on my learning journey with HTML, utilizing 'Notepad,' a built-in editor on Windows. 
Following the advice to save files with a .html extension, 
I began by crafting tables featuring my classmates' names, incorporating photos for visual appeal. 
However, to be honest, I didn't find much enjoyment in the process.



To be honest, I didn't start learning for web design. I searched on Google, asked a
somewhat silly question like "How to make games in HTML," and the results weren't 
what I expected. They all mentioned a word: "javascript." Back then, I had no idea what
JavaScript was. Since I like learning from books, I Googled "javascript book pdf," and
the first link took me to a book called "Eloquent JavaScript" by Marijn Haverbeke

I began reading the book, and I found it really enjoyable. The content was so engaging 
that I completely forgot about making video games and got deeply involved in playing 
around with JavaScript. This book had everything a beginner could ask for in a
JavaScript guide. When I reached the section on Node.js, I felt like a real programmer,  
thinking I deserved to work for a company or something, lol. I started experimenting
with the HTTP module and showcasing my simple APIs that could add two numbers to  
impress my friends.


From that point on, I continued exploring programming and stumbled upon my favorite
programming language to date: Python. As I delved deeper, I found Python to be easier
to learn than JavaScript. Since then, I dedicated two hours daily to learning Python and 
one hour revisiting what I had learned in JavaScript. Following a similar approach to my 
JavaScript learning journey, I came across a book titled 'Automate the Boring Stuff with 
Python' by Al Sweigart.

Continuing with the book, my fondness for Python grew even more. When I reached 
the automation section, I delved into web automation and web scraping. To challenge 
my skills, I created an Instagram bot. This bot would follow accounts and like all the  
photos for each account. It turned out to be my first significant project. When I shared
it with a friend, he suggested that I could make money by selling the bot. I was 
surprised to learn that people were so obsessed with gaining 
followers on social media.


After that, I signed up on freelancing platforms, offering to create Instagram bots and 
boost followers for people. It was hard to believe that I was making money with 
something I had just learned as a hobby.


My journey has continued since then, and I've delved deeper into the world of 
computers and programming. I've learned a variety of frameworks and programming languages. 
So far, I can write code in:

        - Go(golang)
        - Python
        - JavaScript
        - C

I am familiar with different frameworks and Library likes

        - Majority of backend farmeworks in Go (Gorrila mux, Chi, Gin, â€¦)
        - gRPC
        - FastAPI
        - Django Rest Framwork
        - Vuejs
        - TailwindCSS
        - etc


And I can build

        - APIs/Backend
        - RPC Servers
        - CLI Tools
        - Web Aplications
        - etc

In conclusion, I've come to realize the significance of embracing simplicity and
pursuing what genuinely interests you, rather than conforming to others' perceptions
of your strengths. It's a lesson I've learned through my unexpected journey into coding
Initially, I never imagined finding joy in writing lines of code that might not always be 
widely utilized, but I've discovered a profound satisfaction in the creative process.
Following my passion has not only led me to a deeper understanding of various
programming languages but has also become a source of income. So, my advice is to
follow your interests, relish the simplicity of what you enjoy, and, perhaps, you'll find
unexpected opportunities and fulfillment along the way.


Thank you!
