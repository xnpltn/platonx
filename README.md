Hi, I am Platon.
I like building things and I enjoy programming.
I am Interested in `Backend`, `Machine Learning` 
and building `Terminal Applications`.
I like coding with `Go(golang)`, `Python`, `JavaScript` and `C`

This portifolio is made with `Vuejs` with `Typescript` and `Marked`

Just fork it, clone it and run those commands.
